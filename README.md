# Node-Space-Frontend

Node-Space-Frontend is a project created using Create React App (CRA) and written in TypeScript.

State management is primarily done with Redux, mainly for global error handling, while the rest is handled with Context API.

## Features

This platform will do the following:

- Allow developers to create creator accounts
- Write their own blogs
- Have their own following
- Not necessarily worry about the overhead of marketing their content.

It's not just a platform for blogging and community engagement, though. I am also implementing a feature where creators can release courses on any dev-related topic they'd like. For example, I'm focusing on vanilla Node.js to demonstrate real-world practical applications of its built-in modules such as child process, fs, os, buffer, http, etc.

## Styling

Styling is done using:
- styled-components
- CSS
- Material-UI for the component library
- React Icons for the icons
- Google Fonts for the fonts

This is a responsive website.

## Additional Features

- Many custom hooks
- API calls using an API created for this project
- Implementation of restricted routes

## Future Steps

There are plans to:
- Possibly start over with Next.js and Tailwind CSS for better performance and alignment with industry standards.
